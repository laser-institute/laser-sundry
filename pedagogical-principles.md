# LASER Learning Lab Planning

LASER curriculum team: Shaun Kellogg, Shiyan Jiang, Joshua Rosenberg

## General pedagogical principles

1.  Be STEM specific and realistic

    -   situated in STEM ed research
    -   emphasizing specific contexts and situations
    -   gain some sense of the context of the data, possibly in an ethnographic/trial-and-error mode - try out assistments, try out CODAP, understand the data generating process
    -   messy code
    -   gain some sense of the context of the data, possibly in an ethnographic/trial-and-error mode - try out assistments, try out CODAP, understand the data generating process
    -   introducing the unit or possibly each lab with a reference to a STEM Ed Research article to illustrate how a particular technique we'll be learning has been applied in the real world

2.  Use general instructional strategies

    -   specific guidance followed by faded scaffolds/support

    -   sharing with small groups

    -   learners sharing reports/products/presentations with the whole institute

        -   having a product they can share and re-use after each lab (or day)
        -   allowing students to present a final project kind of plan/product

    -   working in groups together to reason about code

    -   having students present in small groups or to share with the class, e.g. jamboard, rather than to the whole class - can grind to a halt

    -   have synchronous time be small-group based

    -   having people demonstrate something interesting from their asynchronous work in the synchronous time is great

    -   use a google slides powerpoint deck to structure small group discussions- students have to put something on a slide specific to them to keep them transparent and responsible

    -   in the learning labs, emphasize why/what kinds of products can be created through doing this

3.  Use programming-specific instructional strategies

    -   using learnr to provide different angles/perspectives on using a function or technique

    -   live coding

        -   asking students to predict what will happen when running code
        -   recording walk-throughs of tricky, specific issues - perhaps ahead of time

    -   plan discussions among students about coding-related things that are interesting or surprising or weird

    -   try to minimize issues with package installation/other installation and access issues - this seems really important

4.  Support motivation

    - early wins - esp. via plots

      - supporting motivation as much as students' conceptual/technical understanding early on

    - think of the first and the big take-aways/"wins" from each unit - first viz, world cloud, etc.

    - first, starting with the end product

    - the cake for each lab (or day our unit) could be a STEM Ed study that utilizes the techniques we are trying to teach.

## Platform

-   RStudio Cloud
-   Allow folks to download projects
-   Ween people off of RStudio Cloud later on

## Presentation - structure

-   The context
-   The terminology/big ideas
-   The literature
-   The lab

## Modules & Labs

### Timeline

-   10 min pres. in xaringan
-   50 min. group practice through a rendered Rmd doc (is that all right?) - possibly learnr
-   30 min. independent wrk?

### Module Structure

In order to help prevent participants from being overwhelmed and allow us to go a little deeper into explaining the concepts (e.g., tokenization) and function we introduce:

-   shift away from four independent analyses/labs that each cover a different analytical technique (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic modeling)
-   move to a single overarching analysis using a single dataset
-   anchor with a research article(s) that spans multiple labs
-   introduce just a couple advanced techniques at most
-   focus first labs on elaborating on the context, data import and data wrangling
-   follow with some basic exploratory analysis to understand the data better like distribution plots, table summaries, word clouds, and the
-   using later labs to demonstrate and practice a more advanced analysis and modeling technique with an opportunity in the
-   conclude last lab for making a pretty table or graph that communicates one key insight from their Knowledge Checks and addresses a guiding research question.

### Lab Components

#### prepare

#### wrangle

#### explore

#### model

#### communicate

-   teaser for topics covered in OCoP later\
-   different "data product" formats and approaches, table and chart for pubs, interactive data table for HTML site, whatever.
